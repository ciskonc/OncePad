## Install

### Pre-built binaries

Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page.

- **Windows (Installer, recommended)**: Download `OncePad-Setup-x.x.x.exe`, run the installer, and OncePad will be permanently installed to `AppData\Local\Programs\OncePad\`. The installer registers file associations for 40+ file types, so double-clicking `.md` / `.txt` / `.js` / `.py` / `.json` / etc. in Explorer will open them in OncePad instantly. The installed version also appears in "Open with" right-click menus.
- **Windows (Portable)**: Download `OncePad x.x.x.exe` and run directly — no installation required. Note: the portable version is a 7z self-extracting executable (~200 MB); each launch extracts to a temp folder, which may cause a delay of several seconds when double-clicking files in Explorer. For daily use, the installer version is strongly recommended.
- **macOS**: Download the `.dmg` (note: unsigned, run `xattr -cr "/Applications/OncePad.app"` if blocked)
- **Linux**: Download the `.AppImage`, make executable, and run

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MagicalYuYu/OncePad.git
cd OncePad
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How it works

1. Press `Alt+Q` (default) to summon the editor from any application
2. Type your text — it auto-saves as a draft
3. Press the shortcut again — the window disappears and your text is copied to clipboard
4. Paste wherever you need it

That's it. No save dialog, no file management, no friction.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Package for current platform
npm run dist

# Package for Windows only
npm run build:win
```
